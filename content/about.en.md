I'm Momiji (Yang), living in CA, USA. I previously studied and worked in Tokyo, Japan for almost a decade. I'm a software engineer with a passion for writing. I write articles in Chinese, Japanese, and English, and I have a WeChat public account called "dadaowalking" where I synchronize my articles.

I'm an avid reader and love to share my thoughts on books, movies, and life. I'm also a big fan of Japanese culture and enjoy sharing my insights on Japanese culture, language, and life.

To write well, express yourself like the common people, but think like a wise man.

Disclaimer: The views expressed here are solely my own and do not represent those of my employer or any organization. Most of my articles are initially written in Chinese and then translated into Japanese and English with the assistance of large language model tools, followed by my own revisions. 

Interested in how I automate the task of using large language model tools to assist in translation? Check out my scripts on [GitHub](https://github.com/hellomomiji/hellomomiji.github.io/tree/main/scripts).
